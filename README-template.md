## 🚀 Overview

The challenge was to build a blog preview card and make it look as close as possible to the provided design.  
Users should be able to:

- See hover states on interactive elements (title hover to yellow)
- View the component in a responsive layout

## 🛠️ Built With

- Semantic **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Flexbox**
- **Mobile-first workflow**
- Google Fonts (Figtree)

## ✨ What I Learned

While building this component, I learned:

- How to structure a clean HTML layout
- How to style using the design system (colors, spacing, shadows)
- How to center a card using Flexbox
- How and when to apply fixed widths vs responsive units
- How to create hover states
- How to add simple media queries

Here is a code snippet I’m proud of:

```css
.title h3:hover {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}
